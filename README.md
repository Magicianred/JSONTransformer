# JSONTransformer

The goal of this project is to create an engine that translates a JSON input file based on a seperate transformation file to give a new structure.

The reason for doing this is to easily allow the passing of data between systems without the need to build a custom intergration. The initial needs were layed down to generate xAPI statements and more functionality will be added as required.

## Getting started

The main function requires 2 parameters, the source you want to translate from and the transformation you want to apply. Both of these are JTokens and therefore can be a JObject or JArray. If the source is a JObject the transformation will only be applied to that object. If the source is a JArray the transformation will be applied to each child object and then appended together for a returning JArray.
