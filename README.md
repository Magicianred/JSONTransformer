# JSONTransformer

The goal of this project is to create an engine that translates a JSON input file based on a seperate transformation file to give a new structure.

The purpose of this is to easily allow the passing of data between systems without the need to build a custom intergration. The initial needs were layed down to generate xAPI statements and more functionality will be added as required.
